# 2048 Game


## Description

2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 appears on the board, but players can continue to play to achieve higher scores.

This project is a web-based implementation of the 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Simple controls: Use arrow keys or swipe gestures to move tiles.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you combine tiles.
- Reset button: Restart the game at any time.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or swipe gestures on mobile devices to move tiles in the desired direction.
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
3. Continue merging tiles and try to reach the 2048 tile to win the game.
4. If there are no more moves available and the board is full, the game is over.
